## Development Guidelines

### YAML Style

* Use 2 spaces for indentation
* Use descriptive variable names
* Add comments for complex logic
* Keep line length reasonable (< 120 characters when possible)

### Variable Naming

* Use snake_case for variables
* Prefix boolean variables with `enable_`, `is_`, or `has_`
* Use descriptive names (not `temp` but `outdoor_temperature_sensor`)

### Documentation

* Update README.md for new features
* Add entries to CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
* Include inline comments for complex Jinja2 templates
* Provide examples for new configuration options

### Testing

When testing your changes:

1. Create a new automation from the blueprint
2. Test with different sensor types (binary_sensor, input_boolean)
3. Test edge cases (sensors changing rapidly, midnight rollover, etc.)
4. Enable Debug Mode and check logs
5. Test with different Home Assistant versions if possible

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines:

* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* First line should be 50 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests when applicable

Examples:
```
Add temperature check feature

Add support for temperature-based notifications.

the configured threshold.
