## Expected Behavior

### Timeline

**Minute 0**: Door opens
- Grace period starts (2 minutes)

**Minute 2**: Detection complete
- First notification sent
- Entrance light turns on

**Minute 12**: First repeat (after 10 minutes)
- Notification #2 sent
- Entrance light flashes

**Minute 22, 32, 42, 52**: Subsequent repeats
- Notifications #3, #4, #5, #6 sent
- Light continues flashing

**Minute 62**: ESCALATION TRIGGERED (6th notification)
- üö® Critical alert sent to all devices
- All house lights flash
- Alarm siren activates
- Partner notified via phone
- Security log created
- **Escalation repeats every 10 minutes** (escalation_repeat_enabled: true)

**During Quiet Time**: 
- Normal notifications suppressed
- Escalations still sent (override enabled)

**Door Closes**:
- All lights turn off
- Siren deactivates
- Notifications deleted
- Wait 30 seconds before considering fully closed

## Use Case

Perfect for:
- Main entrance security monitoring
- Doors that should always be closed
- High-security areas
- Situations requiring immediate response
