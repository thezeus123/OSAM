# Changelog

All notable changes to OSAM (Open Sensor Alert Manager) will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [3.12.1] - 2024-10-24

### Fixed
- **Critical**: Fixed double notifications bug where both escalation and regular notifications were sent simultaneously
- **Critical**: Fixed YAML parsing errors caused by emoji characters (U+008F and similar)
- Escalations now properly ignore daily limit while still incrementing the notification counter

### Changed
- Replaced emoji characters in default notification templates with text equivalents
  - Warning emoji (‚ö†Ô∏è) ‚Üí "WARNUNG:" / "WARNING:"
  - Alert emoji (üö®) ‚Üí "KRITISCH:" / "CRITICAL:"

### Technical Details
- Modified repeat_check trigger to use `if-else` block instead of sequential execution
- Escalation notifications now run in `then` block
- Regular notifications now run in `else` block (only when NO escalation)
- Added counter increment after escalation (previously missing)
- Removed all Unicode control characters that could cause parsing issues

## [3.12.0] - 2024-10-18

### Added
- **Escalation Repeat**: New option to continue sending escalation notifications on every repeat cycle
  - Previously: Escalation sent only once
  - Now: Optional repeated escalations for critical situations
- New input parameter: `escalation_repeat_enabled` (default: false)

### Changed
- Escalation flag `escalation_sent` now only set when repeat is disabled
- Improved escalation logic for repeated critical warnings

## [3.11.0] - 2024-09-28

### Added
- **Optional Quiet Time**: Quiet Time can now be completely disabled for 24/7 monitoring
  - New parameter: `enable_quiet_time` (default: true)
  - When disabled, notifications are sent around the clock
- **Count-based Escalation**: Escalations now trigger after X notifications instead of time duration
  - More predictable and easier to configure
  - New parameter: `escalation_after_count` (replaces time-based trigger)
- **Escalation Override Quiet Time**: Escalations can now be sent even during quiet hours
  - New parameter: `escalation_override_quiet_time` (default: true)
  - Critical alerts no longer blocked by quiet time
- **Separate Escalation Volume**: Different Alexa volume for escalation notifications
  - New parameter: `escalation_alexa_volume` (default: 80%)
  - Normal notifications can be quieter, escalations louder

### Changed
- Improved escalation logic with clearer conditional checks
- Enhanced quiet time calculation to support optional mode
- Escalation conditions now check both quiet time override and current period

### Deprecated
- Time-based escalation trigger (replaced by count-based system)
